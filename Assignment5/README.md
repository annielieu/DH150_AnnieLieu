## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling humanizes user research and data for all stakeholders involved (cross function team, business partners, public) for the sake of helping the product become more user-centric. To create empathy to outsiders, UX storytelling utilizes the emotioms attached to a typical hero's journey (challenges, how to overcome those challenges, and a final solution). Instead of a typical mythical hero, our main character is now several user personas that we present with context, demographic information, and goals, in hopes that our proposes product features serve as a solution for our users' end goals. This helps visualize and reconfirm the validity of our product and user research.

Essentially, UX storytelling provides insight into potential users, allows for a simplified and personable method of presenting product features, and highlights the potential user segmentation applicable to the product.

2. Field Trip Category 
      <p> pre set events by group members or those of the community on homescreen; you can request to join to attend the event; eases the process of combing through different groups and categories for event postings </p>

## Scenerios and Journey Maps

### Mary's Scenario
• As a successful product manager and mom, Jane starts her working day with checking her emails as she cooks up breakfast for her two middle school aged kids and makes sure her high school son has everything ready before he leaves. She has to continuously be checking multiple platforms through out the day to keep track of projects and her team (email, Jira, calendar, and Slack messages, to name a few). Mary Jane wonders if she’ll ever find time for herself. Between juggling her mom life and her career priorities, Mary wants to find a simple way to meet new friends and practice some selfcare in her city that won't need her to onboard another complex system to keep track up.

• Jane opens up the NextDoor app on her phone after she's finished checking for updates on her other platforms. At first, Mary is frustrated when she searches "events for moms nearby" in the search bar, indicated by a magnifiying glass because there is too much information from various feeds showing up, often without chronological order. She decides to refresh the page and try looking for something more helpful. She realizes there is a new category located at the bottom of her homescreen for the app labelled "Field Trip." Once she clicks on this icon, she is taken to a new page that offers a chronological grid of events coming up, that she may be interested in based on her earlier entry of preferences when she first onboarded the app. She is able to see organized events based on several tags (that are dispalyed at the top of each event as she scrolls so she realizes what the event is for) such as "moms" "crafting" "cooking" "girl's night out", etc. This pleases her greatly, as she does not have to scroll through different feeds to get a customized assortment. In addition, because she is busy, she is able to further prioritize the events because there is a "estimated time" for the event (ranging from 30 min to 4 hours) as well as an add to calendar feature. She is able to press not interested on different events to further help cater her choices for the ftuure. Overall, Mary feels satisfied when he sees the Field Trips feed because she can now choose outings most interesting and convenient to her, as a busy mom. After scrolling through the feed, Mary RSVPS (by clicking on the RSVP now button) for an upcoming for the weekend called "Korean Spa and Chill" which leads her into a page witth a mini questionnaire such as "Do you own a vehicle/willing to drive others?" "Have you attended an event with ___ before?" "You have to acquire tickets ahead of time for this location, at this time. Click here to do so." that helps set up everything she needs without the need for follow up emails or meessaging. Mary is excited and sets notifications on for the event in case for any updates and sets down her phone to continue on with her day. 

Jisoo Kim's Scenerio
• Jisoo is a young, stay-at-home mother of 3 children, all under the age of 10 years old. When she is not picking or dropping them off at school/daycare/soccer practice, cooking dinner, cleaning the house, or supervising them, Chelsea is updated her popular mommy blog where she posts about her family, advice on how to balance life with three young kids, and fun events. She is planning on posting a blog post about her friend's upcoming baby shower. Her friend is having a girl and the baby shower will have a pink theme. Since Chelsea wants to take lots of pictures at the baby shower for her blog, she wants to buy a new pink dress in her size (size 6) that costs under $50 so she will look presentable in her photos. Unfortunately, she has no time to go to the mall over the next couple of weeks because she needs to take care of her kids who are home for the summer. Chelsea decides to look for her dress online so that she can shop while also keeping an eye on her kids.

• Chelsea finds a few minutes to open her laptop and sit at the dining room table. She goes onto Amazon and types "dress" in the search bar at the top of the main page and presses the button with the magnifying glass icon to search for results. The page shows a list of dresses, but Chelsea directs her attention to the left-side column of the website where the filters are located. Chelsea is able to view all the filters such as "color,""price,""reviews,""style," and "size." She is pleased that she can see all of the filters at once so she knows what she can adjust. All of the specific features for each filter type is hidden until Chelsea clicks the downward-arrow icon next to the title of the filter she wants to adjust. Since Chelsea is looking for a size 6, pink dress under $50, she clicks the downward-arrow for "size," and clicks the button labeled "6," then clicks the arrow for "color" and selects the pink rectangle, and clicks the arrow next to "price", types in "$0" in the "Min" text box and "$50" in the "Max" text box. Once she has finished adjusting all of her filters, she presses the button labeled "Go" at the bottom of all the filters. The page refreshes and shows dress results that fit Chelsea's filter adjustments. Chelsea feels like she has saved a lot of time because she was able to adjust three different filters and did not have to wait for the entire website to refresh between each adjustment. Chelsea quickly browses thtough the selection of dresses until she finds a dress she likes, knowing that it will be available in her size and fit her price range. She clicks the item's picture and clicks the button labeled "Add to Cart" to purchase the item. Chelsea closes her laptop and goes to the living room to keep an eye on her kids, feeling excited about her new dress and pleased that she was able to narrow down her choices and find a dress specified to her liking so quick and efficienty.
