# DH 150 Assignment 5

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling humanizes user research and data for all stakeholders involved (cross function team, business partners, public) for the sake of helping the product become more user-centric. To create empathy to outsiders, UX storytelling utilizes the emotioms attached to a typical hero's journey (challenges, how to overcome those challenges, and a final solution). Instead of a typical mythical hero, our main character is now several user personas that we present with context, demographic information, and goals, in hopes that our proposes product features serve as a solution for our users' end goals. This helps visualize and reconfirm the validity of our product and user research.

Essentially, UX storytelling provides insight into potential users, allows for a simplified and personable method of presenting product features, and highlights the potential user segmentation applicable to the product.

## Proposed Design Features

1. Filters 
      <p> make filters collapsable by category so all different filter choices are visible on one screen and can be adjusted accordingly for general feedback in realtime </p>

2. Field Trip Category 
      <p> pre set events by group members or those of the community on homescreen; you can request to join to attend the event; eases the process of combing through different groups and categories for event postings </p>

## Scenerios and Journey Maps

### Mary's Scenario
• As a successful product manager and mom, Jane starts her working day with checking her emails as she cooks up breakfast for her two middle school aged kids and makes sure her high school son has everything ready before he leaves. She has to continuously be checking multiple platforms through out the day to keep track of projects and her team (email, Jira, calendar, and Slack messages, to name a few). Mary Jane wonders if she’ll ever find time for herself. Between juggling her mom life and her career priorities, Mary wants to find a simple way to meet new friends and practice some selfcare in her city that won't need her to onboard another complex system to keep track up.

• Jane opens up the NextDoor app on her phone after she's finished checking for updates on her other platforms. At first, Mary is frustrated when she searches "events for moms nearby" in the search bar, indicated by a magnifiying glass because there is too much information from various feeds showing up, often without chronological order. She decides to refresh the page and try looking for something more helpful. She realizes there is a new category located at the bottom of her homescreen for the app labelled "Field Trip." Once she clicks on this icon, she is taken to a new page that offers a chronological grid of events coming up, that she may be interested in based on her earlier entry of preferences when she first onboarded the app. She is able to see organized events based on several tags (that are dispalyed at the top of each event as she scrolls so she realizes what the event is for) such as "moms" "crafting" "cooking" "girl's night out", etc. This pleases her greatly, as she does not have to scroll through different feeds to get a customized assortment. In addition, because she is busy, she is able to further prioritize the events because there is a "estimated time" for the event (ranging from 30 min to 4 hours) as well as an add to calendar feature. She is able to press not interested on different events to further help cater her choices for the ftuure. Overall, Mary feels satisfied when he sees the Field Trips feed because she can now choose outings most interesting and convenient to her, as a busy mom. After scrolling through the feed, Mary RSVPS (by clicking on the RSVP now button) for an upcoming for the weekend called "Korean Spa and Chill" which leads her into a page witth a mini questionnaire such as "Do you own a vehicle/willing to drive others?" "Have you attended an event with ___ before?" "You have to acquire tickets ahead of time for this location, at this time. Click here to do so." that helps set up everything she needs without the need for follow up emails or meessaging. Mary is excited and sets notifications on for the event in case for any updates and sets down her phone to continue on with her day.

### Jisoo Kim's Scenerio
• Jisoo is a young mother that recently quit her corporate job to pursue her online work full time. She makes cooking and food content on creator platforms such as Youtube and Tiktok, and has recently acquired a high stable income from it. As such, she decided she should WFH from her dream state since she was a wee babe and moved her family to Nevada. When she is not picking or dropping her children off at school/daycare/soccer practice, cooking dinner, cleaning the house, or supervising them, Chelsea is updating her popular cooking blog accounts (Tiktok/Youtube/and recently Instagram) where she posts about her what she's eating in a day, cooking recipes, aesthetic home vlogs, advice on how to balance life with three young kids, and fun events. After she settled in a nice routine after a few weeks, Jisoo realized that she hasn't even had time to greet her neighbors or get to know the city that she loved so much as a kid! She decides to download the NextDoor app to try to onboard as much information as she can and meet new people. 

• Jisoo Kim is onboarded quickly while making an account and quickly checks off her most interested categories such as "mom" "cooking" "new to the neighborhood" "self care" and "kid play dates." She is quickly overwhelmed by the variety of options and decides to "Skip" clicking everythign she's interested in. Her homescreen refreshes to show the general Nextdoor feed, which quickly spouts out everything going on in her neighborhood. However, Jisoo is quickly overhwhelmed by the variety of stimuli, randomly, and without order. While scrolling, she sees posts for Lost and Found, Burgulary Reports, and general intros to the the board. She doesn't remember subscribing to any of these channels when she signed up. A quick scan of the page lets Jisoo see that there is a "filter by" category located at the top of the page. She quickly clicks on the button icon and a drop down list of options show up. There is a section labelled filter by channel, where she quickly unchecks all the categories she is not currently interested in such as "Lost and Found" "Burglary Attempt" "Lost Pets" "Politics" and keeps the rest of the categories she's interested in such as "Intros" "Local Recommendations" "Discourse", etc. The drop down menu also displays options to uncheck certain tags, but she finds her the input she previously inputted when onboarding is subscribed and perfect, such as "self care" "kid play dates" "middle school" "mom" "cooking", etc. Once she clicks the button "Apply",  Jisoo is able to view the refreshed page feed that shows customized information and posts that fit Jisoo's filter adjustments. Chelsea feels like she has saved a lot of time and feels more eager to post and engage with her neighbors in topics that she is interested in or has expertise in. Jisoo quickly finds one such post that is labelled "Anyone interested in hopping in a Zoom call for a cooking session? Let's exchange recipes". Futher in the description, the poster mentions they are a mom experiencing nesting syndrome with all her kids in college and wants to cook for large groups again. She specializes in Bulgarian dishes and would love to exchange cultural dishes! Jisoo is excited and comments, and waits for a notification to tell her that the OP has replied. The poster quickly responds and soon they set up a call for Thursday down later the week.  thtough the selection of dresses until she finds a dress she likes, knowing that it will be available in her size and fit her price range. Jisoo puts down her phone and goes to the living room to keep an eye on her kids, feeling excited about her new friend and pleased that she was able to narrow down her choices and find relavant posts specified to her liking so quickly and efficiently.
