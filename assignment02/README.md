# DH150 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing by Annie Lieu

## Introduction 
<p> <strong> NextDoor </strong> is a social networking website and application founded in 2008 in San Francisco to become <em> the </em> informaton and data hub for all things in your neighborhood. The app lets you connect with locals nearby your verified address (have to activate via postcard to your house) so you know your neighbors are trusted connections and can exchange goods, information, recommendations, and services such as restaurant recommendations or a lost and found section or even a safety neighborhood watch feature. </p>

## Purpose of Usability Testing 
<p> The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to improve the usability of the product by observing and testing the users and gathering their feedback. UT helps to identify specific problems from a priortized heuristic evaluation and tests whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to the users. Compared to a heuristic evaluation or other inspection methods, UT is the best way to understand the participant's behaviors and thoughts while being able to observe them navigate the product directly. This helps eliminate biased design experts' intention, and cuts down to the cognitive model and processing an intended target user would actually use with the product. </p>

## Methodology 
<p> This <strong> Pilot Usability Test </strong> tests the three metrics of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. I moderated the usability test with my friend from San Diego as the participant with both of us being in a quiet room in order to test this UT's settings and materials for future UTs. The <strong> pre-test questionnaire </strong> measures the user's first impressions of the NextDoor homepage feed, which hosts most recent and relevant postings from all categories for the site. I observed the user interact with the app (both screenshare and facial expressions) through <strong> three task scenarios </strong> to learn how the app design affects the userâ€™s ability to complete standard tasks. The <strong> post-test questionnaire </strong> measures the user's experience using the app, in terms of ease, time, likelihood to trust and use NextDoor with this task again. The <strong> System Usability Scale measures </strong> the user's attitude toward the app and its usability. The <strong> Product Satisfaction Cards </strong> determine how the website makes them feel and distinct product impressions. This Pilot Usability Test took around 35 minutes. </p> 

### Setting

I used the <strong> Zoom application</strong> software to record both the participant's facial expression and them using the product for tasks through the screensharing feature. The test was conducted in a portable minimalist lab, such that we conducted the test in both ends in a quiet room by ourselves. The devices on both end were <strong> MacBook Pro c. 2017 </strong>. 

### Overall Process of the UT

- Introduction
- Informed Consent
- Background Questions
- Pre-Test Questions
- Task Scenarios
- Post-Test Questionnaire
- System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Product Satisfaction Card
- Demographics (Stop Recording Before This and thank participant for their time)

## Heuristics Being Tested 

| Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Being Tested | Task Scenario |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
|  Error Prevention Scenario | Given the robust variety of categories and options, it's difficult for users (especially novice users) to figure out where to post/go for certain tasks (such as finding recommendations) and no step in place to prevent errors of going to the wrong section | Search the site for sushi recommendations |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | The structure and information of the site can be overwhelming with no clear structure and this can slow down task use severely, lowering effiency and flexibility | Find information about a missing dog on NextDoor |
| Recognition Rather than Recall | There is no algoirthm or feature in place to help remember past searches, past posts read, favorited bookmarks, etc which forces user to recall everything rather than recall | Find previous sushi restaurant based on past search |

## Reflection

<p> Overall, the UT process went smoothly. There were no internet loss or interruptions during the entire 35 minutes. I realized through the process that my participant was familiar with UT testing because she was very vocal throughout the process, even unprompted (later discovered she is a regular usability beta tester for popular app, Costar). I believe that next time, especially for the target audience which is middle aged women who are usually less technology inclined, I can prompt the users with more questionsa and guidance. In addition, what I can do better next time is get someone closer to the target demographic. </p> 

<p> During the UT, there were some minor hiccups with user understanding of the questions/tasks. I could improve this by making the form clearer and changing soem structures. For instance, for the product satisfaction card (and something I also struggled with when I first encountered this google form) is that she felt that she had to pick one from every row because of standardized forms dictating it this way. Finding five randomly from ALL rows affected her thinking a little, and we needed more time than her usual response rate to find the fifth product card. In addition, I believe my tasks were unclear (not in terms of direction, but in terms of usability). For instance, I personally believed that a user looking up sushi recommendations on the search bar was routine and something I would personally do, but the participant mentioned "this isn't something I would do." I believe to be a better UX Researcher and Moderator overall, I should cross reference my task sceanrios as well to make sure it's both clear to the participant in terms of directions and realistic usability. <p> 
  
<p> Overall, to improve this UT for further sessions, I would restructure ambiguous tasks such as the product satisfaction card and the tasks scenarios instead. I will also try to be a more unbiased, but encouraging moderator to more quiet, less vocal participants. </p>
