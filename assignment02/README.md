# DH150 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing by Annie Lieu

## Introduction 
<p> <strong> NextDoor </strong> is a social networking website and application founded in 2008 in San Francisco to become <em> the </em> informaton and data hub for all things in your neighborhood. The app lets you connect with locals nearby your verified address (have to activate via postcard to your house) so you know your neighbors are trusted connections and can exchange goods, information, recommendations, and services such as restaurant recommendations or a lost and found section or even a safety neighborhood watch feature. </p>

## Purpose of Usability Testing 
<p> The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to improve the usability of the product by observing and testing the users and gathering their feedback. UT helps to identify specific problems from a priortized heuristic evaluation and tests whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to the users. Compared to a heuristic evaluation or other inspection methods, UT is the best way to understand the participant's behaviors and thoughts while being able to observe them navigate the product directly. This helps eliminate biased design experts' intention, and cuts down to the cognitive model and processing an intended target user would actually use with the product. </p>

## Methodology 
<p> This <strong> Pilot Usability Test </strong> tests the three metrics of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. I moderated the usability test with my friend from San Diego as the participant with both of us being in a quiet room in order to test this UT's settings and materials for future UTs. The <strong> pre-test questionnaire </strong> measures the user's first impressions of the NextDoor homepage feed, which hosts most recent and relevant postings from all categories for the site. I observed the user interact with the app (both screenshare and facial expressions) through <strong> three task scenarios </strong> to learn how the app design affects the userâ€™s ability to complete standard tasks. The <strong> post-test questionnaire </strong> measures the user's experience using the app, in terms of ease, time, likelihood to trust and use NextDoor with this task again. The <strong> System Usability Scale measures </strong> the user's attitude toward the app and its usability. The <strong> Product Satisfaction Cards </strong> determine how the website makes them feel and distinct product impressions. This Pilot Usability Test took around 35 minutes. </p> 

### Setting

I used the <strong> Zoom application</strong> software to record both the participant's facial expression and them using the product for tasks through the screensharing feature. The test was conducted in a portable minimalist lab, such that we conducted the test in both ends in a quiet room by ourselves. The devices on both end were <strong> MacBook Pro c. 2017 </strong>.
