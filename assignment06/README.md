## DH150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype
by Annie Lieu // Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Fall 2020 // Dr. Sookie Cho

## Mission: 
This low-fidelity prototype (Figma wireframe) serves to validate whether new proposed features are helpful and usable by the target user demographic before launching into a high fidelity prototype. 

## User Persona: 
Target user demographic for this application would be middle aged women from all sorts of life (mothers, single ladies, from all different careers) that want a platform that will enable them to efficiently acclimate to their neighborhood/town and expand their network safely.

## Features & Tasks: 
The features and tasks of this low-fi prototype were ideated through various steps of user research, including usability testing of existing Nextdoor and Meetup features, contextual inquiry of a target user, and other observations made about existing social media and alternative platforms that help you "meet strangers" online. The three features include: a filtered category to customize your home feed to posts of value and interest; adding a field trip category to center all pre approved and organized releavnt events on one page.

## Notes on Wireflow Test
Task 1: "Filter" category for general feed page 

I made a very low fidelity prototype on drawing and had a middle aged mother (my target audience) try out the wireflow. However, because I used a low fidelity drawing instead of consistent Figma basic wireframe, their immediate notation was that they were very confused and couldn't read any of the notes/text. This severely impacts user experience and required me explaining what each button indicated at first. However, after explanation, teh user was able to quickly go through the wireframe, following along the arrows easily. They noted that they don't think the filters are organized in the best way, and on this wireframe it is not obvious what tags or groups are based off the example posting. However, despite these setbacks, they followed the wireflow easily. 

Task 2: Fieldtrip Category

Immediate remarks were that the icon indicating "fieldtrips" was cute but not very intuitive. The bus icon seemed childish and opposite of the fact of adults trying to plan events together. Again, same issues with poor illustration and design; and not fleshing out core details such as what the tags on the bottom of posts look like. Otherwise, teh general conceptual model behind the wireflow made sense to the user. 

## Summary Reflection
I wanted to make a Figma basic wireframe but didn't have the bandwidth this past week to do so so decided to sketch out some iterations to have a user test. I understand that this is the very firs tstage of user wireflow testing, however, because my drawings lacked consistency and legibility this severely impacted my testing. Also, I drew arrows to indicate how wireflow should go, and gave the highlighter to my user to test out and they simply followed the arrows, so I believe the built in Figma wireframe interactions would have helped me a lot in this manner. Overall, I wish I had more time and bandwidth to actually draw out or make a low fidelity prototype on Figma to really practice the wireflow. That would definitely help testing out the intuitive of how icons look, "clicks" etc. I learned a lot in that this part of the design process seems very hard and time consuming.
