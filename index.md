	<h1> CityPost: DH 150 Assignment 9 </h1>
	<h3> By Annie Lieu</h3>
	<h4> In a world that demands digital nomadacy and remote lifestyles, the way we access information and communicate with each other online becomes essential. As various social media platforms battle to become onlines networks on a global stage, we sought to bring social media back home; back to your community and your neighborhood. </h4>

	<h3> Design Statement </h3>
	<p> <em> How might I design an accessible digital experience that shares information, events, and builds community for middle aged women? </em> </p>
	<p> Currently, reigning social media apps (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube) battle to become the top host site to connect people on a global stage (boasting millions of DAUs) . While this is important, I realized that, especially with quarantine, we were losing sight of organic relationships we fostered before social media; with our neighbors. Too often it is easier to simply connect with strangers online than to know your neighbor's name. I sought to build a niche social media platform that was catered to rebuild that trust and authentic friendships with those we live with. </p>

	<p> Middle aged women, in particular, lie at a point of society where meeting strangers online is an extra security concern. I designed with them as a target audience in mind becuase I wanted a platform that was safe (vetted neighbors) as well as very easy to use and onboard due to middle aged women's busy lifestyles. </p>

	<h3> Competitor Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation </h3>

	<p>I started this design process by analyzing top comptetitors in the "neighborhood" social media space: <b>NextDoor</b> and <b>Meetup</b>. This included a heuristic evaluation and usability testing with participants and detailed process and findings can be found <a href="https://github.com/annielieu/DH150_AnnieLieu/tree/main/assignment02">here</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/annielieu/DH150_AnnieLieu/blob/main/README.md">here</a> . 

	In general, participants found that Nextdoor was too cluttered with information, making it <em>frustrating to navigate </em> for certain tasks and information. Specifically, there was a lack of filters, organizational structure, and overstimulation of categories. On the other hand, participants found Meetup <em>underwhelmingingly too simple and generalized </em> to host a broader span of interests/important information to build a community. Specifically, instead of building a general sense of community, Meetup served more as a temporary function to host niche groups' meetups. </p>


	<h3> User Research: Contextual Inquiry </h3>

	<p>
		After reviewing feedback from the prior usability testing and heuristic evaluation, I conducted further user research using an contextual inquiry interview. My main purpose was to narrow down key pain points and needs in users when they are seeking to build community within their smaller networks. <em>What isn't working? What is? What would an ideal neighborhood platform look like? What is the root cause they are using such platforms? </em>
	</p>
	<p>

		The detailed process and findings of my contextual inquiry can be found <a href="https://github.com/annielieu/DH150_AnnieLieu/tree/main/assignment4">here</a>. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		General findings showed that having more structure and filters overall would help improve user experience on these social media platforms that often host a lot of information. Whether that be hosting down to specific categories/specific kind of information users are looking for, or being able to navigate towards "favorites" category. 
	</p> 

	<h3> User Experience Storytelling </h3>

	<p> 
		With the foundings from the contextual inquiry, I was able to scope out user personas and scenarios with "loved categories" and "structural filters" in mind. Specifically, I focused on two middle aged women who were using this new app, CityPost, in for two different specific tasks.

	<p>
		As a successful product manager and mom, our first user Mary Jane starts her working day with checking her emails as she cooks up breakfast for her two middle school aged kids and makes sure her high school son has everything ready before he leaves. Between juggling her mom life and her career priorities, Mary wants to find a simple way to meet new friends and practice some selfcare in her city that won't need her to onboard another complex system to keep track up. With the new <em> Field Trip feature </em> that had been lacking in previous platforms, Jane is able to successfully find events nearby with minimal time and effort and build genuine connections faster. </p>

			Our second user, Jisoo Kim, is a young mother that makes cooking and food content on creator platforms such as Youtube and Tiktok, and has recently acquired a high stable income from it. After moving to a new city, Jisoo wants to onboard as much information as she can quickly so she can get to know her neighbors and integrate into the community. To become a "local". With the new <em> filter categorization </em> she can filter out most relevant groups and posts to her to acquit to the community faster, rather than navigate through miles of irrelvant postings. </p>

<h3> The Wireframe & Lo-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

<p> I soon began on initial wireframes for my low-fidelity prototype. I sketched out a couple main screens for my two task features. 1)Filter categorization. 2) Pre-set Field Trips feature. These wireframes were bare bones of what this platform should look like and provided a consistent interface structure for the rest of my low-fidelity prototype.

The rest of the low-fidelity prototype involved introducing a wireflow between screens that was then reviewed by participants.

<h3> Hi-Fidelity Prototype </h3>

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FIANApv1Ld602PXJ9RVdt75%2Fneighborhood-app%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> With a better sense of the interaction flow of my prototype, I proceeded to the high-fidelity aspects of my design. Through Figma, I refined and brought my low-fidelity interface to life by adding color, interaction features, dynamic elements, and other graphical interface components on a standard mobile frame. I modelled standard social media practices with posts and profiles, but added key features to help in three important tasks. </p>

<p>The hi-fidelity prototype also went through several revisions after congitive walkthroughs from my professor and other participants. </p>

<p> For instance, further color contrasting testing was needed to create more accessible text content (light grey on white --> black on white for small captioning). Also needed to add more elements to help show buttons as clickable rather than dull uninteractive text. </p>

<p>The high-fidelity prototype supports several tasks:</p>

<h5> 1. Use filters to customize feed</h5>
<h5> 2. Make a new post </h5>
<h5> 3. Use Field Trip Category to sign up for pre-set nearby events </h5>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>

<p> There were several crucial elements I learned to the UX design process with CityPost this quarter.
<h5> 1. The Importance Of Diverse Interview Processes</h5>
<p> I learned that understanding user experience means trying to have the most broad spectrum of possible users to research and interview. This is because oftentimes relying solely on the designer or a couple of similar interviews does not allow one to see edge cases or missing user flows for users from other demographics/groups. This falls into designer and hindsight bias. The best way to counterract this is a more exhaustive list of research and user participants to test on to createa. more fitted design. I saw this in particular through my contextual inquiry interviews, as the participant questioned the way I was asking or telling them to complete a task.</p>

<h5>2. Designing for Accessibility </h5>
<p> In a world that is growing increasingly digital, it is imperative that designers build accessible user experiences that allow for everyone to participate. As a designer, I learned how to use color contrast testing sites and plug ins to make sure that my designs passed the contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for them to be distinguished clearly for all users. I learned that this pertained to all aspects of the design, as a cognitive walkthrough showed me, not just the main elements. For instance, I had to tweak my hi-fidelity prototype to have black text for the "minutes posted" to fix a color contrast error. </p>

<h5> 3. Decisions, Decisions </h5> 
</p> As a designer, it is important that every element of a design made reflects the value that was researched behind that decision to implement it. Specifically, because I came onto this project with a notion to "make a more simple, easier app" that wasn't "cluttered" like its competitors, I made several design choices that can leave users puzzled. I had several reviewers ask why the "filters" tab didn't take the whole screen real estate, or why one couldn't see all teh filters/tags applied on the general feedback page. The answer was for the sake of keeping things cluttered and minimal screens needed as possible (a pop up filter screen that you can scroll doesn't make the user feel like there's several screens before you get to an end product). To the novel user, who didn't know I designed with that in mind, their cognitive model felt like something was missing. I failed to show my intention and why it was useful, and that is a key element to a good design. </p>

<h5> Iterative Legibility </h5>
<p> All my lo fidelity processing involved poor and bare bone wireframes. To my participants I asked to review it, they were left more puzzled and confused by the handwriting than the wireflow itself. </p>

<h5> Internal Consistency </h5>
<p> While Figma helped ease and create a lot of consistency between screens, I found that I still lacked that keen eye and constant review to fix internal consistency errors before user review. As such, I found myself tweaking the hi - fidelity prototype several times to attempt to finish off with a professional error. For instance, I attempted to make buttons more clickable by adding an arrow, as well as making sure buttons and titles were centered.
