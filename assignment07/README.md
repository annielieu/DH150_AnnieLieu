## DH 150 Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype CityPost Part One 
### DH 150 Fall Quarter 2020, Professor Sookie 
### Purpose
The purpose of a high fidelity prototype is to further test the usability of key proposed features or full application interactions for a product. In this specific stage of the
high fidelity prototype, we are testing for clear understanding, discoverability, and functionality given a more structured, detailed, and GUI compliant interface. Moving forward
with this project, I've decided to utilize the Figma application to iterate and design a more complete wireframe for the app, CityPost (name pending), to have target audiences 
test. This high-fidelity prototype is transformed from the low-fidelity hand-drawn prototype with improved graphic elements, UI material components, and features.
