## DH 150 Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype CityPost Part One 
### DH 150 Fall Quarter 2020, Professor Sookie 
### Purpose
The purpose of a high fidelity prototype is to further test the usability of key proposed features or full application interactions for a product. In this specific stage of the
high fidelity prototype, we are testing for clear understanding, discoverability, and functionality given a more structured, detailed, and GUI compliant interface. Moving forward
with this project, I've decided to utilize the Figma application to iterate and design a more complete wireframe for the app, CityPost (name pending), to have target audiences 
test. This high-fidelity prototype is transformed from the low-fidelity hand-drawn prototype with improved graphic elements, UI material components, and features.

### Prototype Design 

#### Representative Screen Designs

Application used was Figma and I decided to iterate out through the task of utilizing the filter function to customize and create a better suited feed for a user. During the iteration process, I actually axed out a "Interests" screen that is part of the onboarding process right after you sign up, because I felt that if the algorithm didn't cater to that anyways, it was a waste of time. And that it made more sense for users to get a jumble of potential interested posts (that they might not be able to see and find out they are interested in if we start out with a filtered post), and then scale/filter down. However, this is not an intuitive process for users, as later mentioned by my participant in the impression test.

I first went with a variation of blue, to keep in line with the social media blue schema (Facebook, Twitter,etc) but decided to stick with

Stuck with standard Figma material design for easier understability and discoverability.

Target Audience was not immediately available so I asked my younger brother who had no prior knowledge of my project for a quick impression test. Key things I probed for was if this wireflow process made sense (are there screens/loadings he feels is missing, color, typography, and general UI layout).

Key Findings: 

1. Participant noted there is a missing flow in between sign up to feed. Most social feeds ask for interests in the beginning to generatea more custom feed. 
2. Wanted a dark mode function when asked about layout/color/typography. "Lots of users use their phone at night; it's taxing." This can be especially true for my target audience.

### Reflection 

I had the chance to build out the confusing aspects of my low fidelity prototype,and the details made the process a lot easier to follow. I decided to make the wrong executive decision of taking out a "Interests"Onboarding Screen,because I felt like you had to go through that process in the filters function, and obviously the onboarding generated algorithm wasn't helping if they felt the need to go to the filter function. I believe this designer errror is known as hindsight bias and I will make sure to keep that in mind moving forward with this high fidelity prototype.
