# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluaton 


### My name is Annie Lieu and this is my assignment for DH 150 with Professor Sookyung. For this assignment I decided to evaluate competitors based on websites/apps that help you get to know your neighborhood, especially for middle aged women. This is because I feel middle aged women that move to new cities might have a hard time adapting (thinking concerns about safety, population density, etc). I feel like designing a UX project surrounding this end goal and function for middle aged women would help solve a lot of pain points! 

## App 1: Nextdoor 

URL: https://nextdoor.com/
Summary --> Nextdoor aims to be the ultimate hub for all things about your neighborhood, including but not limited to building trusted connections, exchanging local helpful information, and joining your neighborhood network. 

#### Overall evaluation: 
      --> I believe Nextdoor helps solve a very crucial pain point, especially in a world where it seems we are seemingly becoming more disinterested in our neighbors. It's ambitious attempt to be the be all end all for all things neighborhood was effective in getting 1) lots of users and 2) lots of content being pusehd by those users but I believe that its overall disorganized information architecture and design dampens that delightful experience of interacting with your neighbors digitally becaues it's too cluttered and messy.
