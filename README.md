# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluaton 


### My name is Annie Lieu and this is my assignment for DH 150 with Professor Sookyung. For this assignment I decided to evaluate competitors based on websites/apps that help you get to know your neighborhood, especially for middle aged women. This is because I feel middle aged women that move to new cities might have a hard time adapting (thinking concerns about safety, population density, etc). I feel like designing a UX project surrounding this end goal and function for middle aged women would help solve a lot of pain points! 

## App 1: Nextdoor 

URL: https://nextdoor.com/

<p> Summary : Nextdoor aims to be the ultimate hub for all things about your neighborhood, including but not limited to building trusted connections, exchanging local helpful information, and joining your neighborhood network. </p>

#### Overall evaluation: 
 <p> I believe Nextdoor helps solve a very crucial pain point, especially in a world where it seems we are seemingly becoming more disinterested in our neighbors. It's ambitious attempt to be the be all end all for all things neighborhood was effective in getting 1) lots of users and 2) lots of content being pusehd by those users but I believe that its overall disorganized information architecture and design dampens that delightful experience of interacting with your neighbors digitally. </p>
      
      
### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visbility of System Status - Severity Level: OK

<p> Visbility of System Status is one of the most important points in an app. Nextdoor suceeds in guiding users through their steps of onboarding onto their neighborhood ("Step 3 of 6 completed to onboarding to Los Angeles." The constant real time updates of notifcation is also a good indicator of system and user status. Overall, systematically the user has a good grasp on status. </p>

#### 2. Match Between System and Real World - Severity Level: OK

<p> Nextdoor sticks to pre established conventions to help ease the user cognition processihng. Overall, nothing new here. Bell icon continued to indicate notifcations, A dog icon continues to signify pets, and even the help settings follow normalized conventions so the user shouldn't have to do guesswork as to what any icons/buttons mean. </p>


#### 3. User Control and Freedom - Severity Level: 2

<p> When first onboarding to the app, Nextdoor <em> forces</em> you to make a first post to "introduce yousrelf to the neighborhood." While this is a good way to increase initital engagemnt within the app by creating more content, a lot of users would want to first see what Nextdoor and thir neighborhood is about before posting. The app removed all next/back buttons to allow you to do so, and creates an impression that they will do this often after. For this point, severity is on the more extreme end. </p>

#### 4. Consistency and Standards - Severity Level: OK

<p> Nextdoor follows all other e commerce and social media sites for icons/processes/ and flows. For example, the bell icon stands for notifs, the chat bubble app stands for messaging. Similiarly, even the structure as a social media site follows standardized convventions of other social media sites such as Facebook (which also breaks down into business, groups, messaging, etc. </p>

#### 5. Error Prevention - Severity Level: OK

<p> Nextdoor follows all other e commerce and social media sites for icons/processes/ and flows. For example, the bell icon stands for notifs, the chat bubble app stands for messaging. Similiarly, even the structure as a social media site follows standardized convventions of other social media sites such as Facebook (which also breaks down into business, groups, messaging, etc. </p>
