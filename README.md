# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluaton 


### My name is Annie Lieu and this is my assignment for DH 150 with Professor Sookyung. For this assignment I decided to evaluate competitors based on websites/apps that help you get to know your neighborhood, especially for middle aged women. This is because I feel middle aged women that move to new cities might have a hard time adapting (thinking concerns about safety, population density, etc). I feel like designing a UX project surrounding this end goal and function for middle aged women would help solve a lot of pain points! 

## App 1: Nextdoor

<p> <strong>Summary</strong> : Nextdoor aims to be the ultimate hub for all things about your neighborhood, including but not limited to building trusted connections, exchanging local helpful information, and joining your neighborhood network. </p>

#### Overall evaluation: 
 <p> I believe Nextdoor helps solve a very crucial pain point, especially in a world where it seems we are seemingly becoming more disinterested in our neighbors. It's ambitious attempt to be the be all end all for all things neighborhood was effective in getting 1) lots of users and 2) lots of content being pusehd by those users but I believe that its overall disorganized information architecture and design dampens that delightful experience of interacting with your neighbors digitally. </p>
      
      
### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visbility of System Status - Severity Level: OK

<p> Visbility of System Status is one of the most important points in an app. Nextdoor suceeds in guiding users through their steps of onboarding onto their neighborhood ("Step 3 of 6 completed to onboarding to Los Angeles." The constant real time updates of notifcation is also a good indicator of system and user status. Overall, systematically the user has a good grasp on status. </p>

#### 2. Match Between System and Real World - Severity Level: OK

<p> Nextdoor sticks to pre established conventions to help ease the user cognition processihng. Overall, nothing new here. Bell icon continued to indicate notifcations, A dog icon continues to signify pets, and even the help settings follow normalized conventions so the user shouldn't have to do guesswork as to what any icons/buttons mean. </p>


#### 3. User Control and Freedom - Severity Level: 2

<p> When first onboarding to the app, Nextdoor <em> forces</em> you to make a first post to "introduce yousrelf to the neighborhood." While this is a good way to increase initital engagemnt within the app by creating more content, a lot of users would want to first see what Nextdoor and thir neighborhood is about before posting. The app removed all next/back buttons to allow you to do so, and creates an impression that they will do this often after. For this point, severity is on the more extreme end. </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Place buttons that users to skip non esesntial onboarding functions to instill user trust and flow. </p> 

#### 4. Consistency and Standards - Severity Level: OK

<p> Nextdoor follows all other e commerce and social media sites for icons/processes/ and flows. For example, the bell icon stands for notifs, the chat bubble app stands for messaging. Similiarly, even the structure as a social media site follows standardized convventions of other social media sites such as Facebook (which also breaks down into business, groups, messaging, etc. </p>

#### 5. Error Prevention - Severity Level: 3

<p> No clear distinctions for posts. A first time user might suffer choice paralysis or not understandign what specific postings are for. For instance, when a user goes to click on "recommendation post" they might mean to ask for recommendations for sushi, as the app advertises that you can come to the platform to find <em> catered </em> recommendations. However, when they ask for sushi reocmmendations by posting on the recommendation feed, they'll realize after radio silence that you only make posts on the recommendation page to recommend to someone else. Overall, no clear distinction ,tutorial, or error check to make sure this doesn't happen. This impacts user experience severely. </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Onboarding tutorial algorithm that plays as you move along the app and make your first recommendation, or question to forum, or local eatery ask </p>
      
 #### 6. Recognition rather than Recall - Severity Level: 3

<p> Text and info dense heavy app and yet there is no "past searches" function or lettings users create drafts for posts or being able to favorite groups so you can prioritize information and news that matter. Instead, dumps everything on you with no clear organization. Severely impacts user experience to find something relevant for them.   </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Introduce past searches function and a way to favorite importnat groups to proioritie them first on your feed. </p>

#### 7. Flexiblity and Efficiency of Use - Severity Level: 3

<p> Messy for both inexperienced users and old users. Again, for users that stay regular on the application, it seems they learn to ignore a lot of useless functions/information (unsubscribing and filtering seems to be a more advanced user flow and requires hidden steps), when that should be the most important feature of an information hub.  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Prioritize iimportant features to front of the design (no interested, unsubscribe, show more posts like this). </p>

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design - Severity Level: 2

<p> Ties into flexibility and efficiency and error prevention. Very cluttered and obstructs user intention and experience. For instance, no categorization for the feed, unsubscribing or pressing not interested in tehse type of posts is not an option. Overall, looks like a messy neighborhood forum.  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> By proiortizing front facing features and eliminating those that are least used or effects (and we can track some metrics for that) we can help clean the app to make it easier and more effective for the users. </p>

#### 9. Help Users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Severity Level: 2

<p> When something fails to post, there is no option to contact for help (users have to do that manually). As well as offering no take away alternatives as to what has gone wrong.  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Suggest and contact us button for more help.</p>

#### 10. Help Users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Severity Level: 1

<p> Again, if there is a real time error there is no option for users to click into the help utilities. Instead, users have to manually find the hidden help button (at the bottom of a long list of settings) and sort through help lists that are dense, and long for each category (showing that this app is very confusing to use).  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Eliminate errors before they begin by working on all the other severity levels.  </p>
