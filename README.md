# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluaton 
##Potential Project Name: TalkLocal

### My name is Annie Lieu and this is my assignment for DH 150 with Professor Sookyung. For this assignment I decided to evaluate competitors based on websites/apps that help you get to know your neighborhood, especially for middle aged women. This is because I feel middle aged women that move to new cities might have a hard time adapting (thinking concerns about safety, population density, etc). I feel like designing a UX project surrounding this end goal and function for middle aged women would help solve a lot of pain points! 

## App 1: Nextdoor

URL: https://nextdoor.com/

<p> <strong>Summary</strong> : Nextdoor aims to be the ultimate hub for all things about your neighborhood, including but not limited to building trusted connections, exchanging local helpful information, and joining your neighborhood network. </p>

#### Overall evaluation: 
 <p> I believe Nextdoor helps solve a very crucial pain point, especially in a world where it seems we are seemingly becoming more disinterested in our neighbors. It's ambitious attempt to be the be all end all for all things neighborhood was effective in getting 1) lots of users and 2) lots of content being pusehd by those users but I believe that its overall disorganized information architecture and design dampens that delightful experience of interacting with your neighbors digitally. </p>
      
      
### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visbility of System Status - Severity Level: OK

<p> Visbility of System Status is one of the most important points in an app. Nextdoor suceeds in guiding users through their steps of onboarding onto their neighborhood ("Step 3 of 6 completed to onboarding to Los Angeles." The constant real time updates of notifcation is also a good indicator of system and user status. Overall, systematically the user has a good grasp on status. </p>

#### 2. Match Between System and Real World - Severity Level: OK

<p> Nextdoor sticks to pre established conventions to help ease the user cognition processihng. Overall, nothing new here. Bell icon continued to indicate notifcations, A dog icon continues to signify pets, and even the help settings follow normalized conventions so the user shouldn't have to do guesswork as to what any icons/buttons mean. </p>


#### 3. User Control and Freedom - Severity Level: 2

<p> When first onboarding to the app, Nextdoor <em> forces</em> you to make a first post to "introduce yousrelf to the neighborhood." While this is a good way to increase initital engagemnt within the app by creating more content, a lot of users would want to first see what Nextdoor and thir neighborhood is about before posting. The app removed all next/back buttons to allow you to do so, and creates an impression that they will do this often after. For this point, severity is on the more extreme end. </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Place buttons that users to skip non esesntial onboarding functions to instill user trust and flow. </p> 

#### 4. Consistency and Standards - Severity Level: OK

<p> Nextdoor follows all other e commerce and social media sites for icons/processes/ and flows. For example, the bell icon stands for notifs, the chat bubble app stands for messaging. Similiarly, even the structure as a social media site follows standardized convventions of other social media sites such as Facebook (which also breaks down into business, groups, messaging, etc. </p>

#### 5. Error Prevention - Severity Level: 3

<p> No clear distinctions for posts. A first time user might suffer choice paralysis or not understandign what specific postings are for. For instance, when a user goes to click on "recommendation post" they might mean to ask for recommendations for sushi, as the app advertises that you can come to the platform to find <em> catered </em> recommendations. However, when they ask for sushi reocmmendations by posting on the recommendation feed, they'll realize after radio silence that you only make posts on the recommendation page to recommend to someone else. Overall, no clear distinction ,tutorial, or error check to make sure this doesn't happen. This impacts user experience severely. </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Onboarding tutorial algorithm that plays as you move along the app and make your first recommendation, or question to forum, or local eatery ask </p>
      
 #### 6. Recognition rather than Recall - Severity Level: 3

<p> Text and info dense heavy app and yet there is no "past searches" function or lettings users create drafts for posts or being able to favorite groups so you can prioritize information and news that matter. Instead, dumps everything on you with no clear organization. Severely impacts user experience to find something relevant for them.   </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Introduce past searches function and a way to favorite importnat groups to proioritie them first on your feed. </p>

#### 7. Flexiblity and Efficiency of Use - Severity Level: 3

<p> Messy for both inexperienced users and old users. Again, for users that stay regular on the application, it seems they learn to ignore a lot of useless functions/information (unsubscribing and filtering seems to be a more advanced user flow and requires hidden steps), when that should be the most important feature of an information hub.  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Prioritize iimportant features to front of the design (no interested, unsubscribe, show more posts like this). </p>

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design - Severity Level: 2

<p> Ties into flexibility and efficiency and error prevention. Very cluttered and obstructs user intention and experience. For instance, no categorization for the feed, unsubscribing or pressing not interested in tehse type of posts is not an option. Overall, looks like a messy neighborhood forum.  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> By proiortizing front facing features and eliminating those that are least used or effects (and we can track some metrics for that) we can help clean the app to make it easier and more effective for the users. </p>

#### 9. Help Users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Severity Level: 2

<p> When something fails to post, there is no option to contact for help (users have to do that manually). As well as offering no take away alternatives as to what has gone wrong.  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Suggest and contact us button for more help.</p>

#### 10. Help Users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Severity Level: 1

<p> Again, if there is a real time error there is no option for users to click into the help utilities. Instead, users have to manually find the hidden help button (at the bottom of a long list of settings) and sort through help lists that are dense, and long for each category (showing that this app is very confusing to use).  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Eliminate errors before they begin by working on all the other severity levels.  </p>
  
## App 2: Meetup

URL: https://www.meetup.com/home/

<p> <strong>Summary</strong> : Nextdoor aims to organize online groups that host events for people with similar interests. </p>

#### Overall evaluation: 
 <p> I believe Meetup is very useful in connecting local communities together. Its web interface is very clean and easy to use. However, it doesn't seem to build individualized repoirt with Meetup Members but rather very event focused and might lose its main goal from there. </p>
      
      
### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visbility of System Status - Severity Level: 3

<p> While Meetup is very good at promoting and hosting information about events, they lack real time progress reports of events for users. The only thing they can track for general users is the number of people RSVPed to attend. However, as a user I would be interested in knowing the countdown to events, past events metrics, and more (similar to eventbrite and Facebook events). Since this is an entirely event based website, this severity level impacts users heavily. </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Introduce more metrics, especially for events you've RSVPEd to.   </p>

#### 2. Match Between System and Real World - Severity Level: OK

<p> Standard work with icons, processing flow (for messaging, creating an event, creating a group, etc. Nothing to confuse or obstruct the user flow. </p>

#### 3. User Control and Freedom - Severity Level: OK

<p> Clear back and exit and even cancel payment method buttons for users to control the site to their goal. Overall, this site is okay in terms of building user trust. </p>

#### 4. Consistency and Standards - Severity Level: 3

<p> While the design and interface of the website is clean, meetup does not offer any customized structure to event feeds. As a semi-social media site, Meetup is falling behind from other platforms that customize event recommendations rather just posting most recent events posted. </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Customized recommendation algorithm based on past events attended/interested in. </p> 

#### 5. Error Prevention - Severity Level: 3

<p> Had to cycle through the various options for signing up (Google, Email, Facebook) because none of the options were working. There was no error button to contact for help. Horrible error</p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Offer check ins to severe errors, especially for user acquisiton purposes.  </p>
      
 #### 6. Recognition rather than Recall - Severity Level: 2

<p> Again, offers no recommendation algorithm to present users with upon using the site, which forces the user to either manually look up something of interest or scroll through a bottomless feed until they find something. For an entirely event based platform, this would help with retention and engagement severely instead of meetup being a one stop shop for a specific event!   </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Recommendation algorithm! </p>

#### 7. Flexiblity and Efficiency of Use - Severity Level: OK

<p> Overall, very minmalist and clean. Just has limited options so less efficiency but no trouble to find a specific function/button if you're looking for it.  </p>

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design - Severity Level: OK

<p> Very clean and unobtrusive to overall user function. Lots of white space.  </p>


#### 9. Help Users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Severity Level: 3

<p> Offers no contact us/what went wrong options when presented with an error, just never loads. Such as when a user signs up and fails to get past the loading page to onboard Facebook logindata,etc. As well as if an event or group fails to be posted. Have to manually find help or contact page in settings.  </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Error check ins with pop ups (most popular or more reasonable explanation) as well as a pathway to help instilled. </p>

#### 10. Help Users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Severity Level: 1

<p> While there is a lack of immediate direction to the help page if there is a real time error, the help page itself is very well organized and offers easy top level processing with the most popular help questions being grouped first into 1)category of question 2)specific page of that category for the question to 4) most specific categories.   </p>

<p> <em> Solution: </em> Allow error check ins with pop ups for real time errors that direct to a very efficent and useful help page!  </p>
