# DH150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry: Users in Context

#### by Annie Lieu // Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Fall 2020 // Dr. Sookyung Cho // 11.02.2020

## The Main Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

> <p> This project would support users in being able to get to know their neighborhood better, as well as find and connect with trusted people nearby, more easily. This will hopefully serve to make the community of middle aged womencommunity, whether mums or single ladies, in metropolitan cities happier and more excited to move to new places safely. </p>

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

> This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety and belongingness because they feel that they can trust people in their neighborhood/city better (saely because it's verified) as well as add to their network of potential friends and activities. They feel that they are not having a difficult moving or living in the city and that they are not alone; they they belong. 

#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

> Current technical solutions to satisfy this need for getting to know your neighborhood/city include other applications with adjacent websites, which are popular, but from personal observation, seem to confuse and muddle novel users because they do not effectively design for large user hubs (which is what an application built to learning and discovering your city requires). Older, more traditional solutions rely on local users finding solo papers in coffee shops/etc adveritsing a local club/org or from a personal friend network that could connect you to others they know in the city. 

#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

> Certain limitations for getting to know your neighborhood is the increasing danger of meeting strangers without prior vetting for safety. This could be improved by vetting every sign up user for a real valid mailing address, so a user can trust anyone registered in this neighborhood forum is an actual neighbor. That greatly decreases the chance of stranger danger. Other limitations lending to traditional views of getting to know your neighborhood include lack of user awareness. before, these orgs and local clubs relied on word of mouth, but because of an increase in contactless consumption, people are spending less and less time reading signs posted on coffee shops, etc and more and more of this form of marketing is being missed. Having a one stop online (semi-permanent] hub where all this information can be posted and easily found by those in the community would greatly increase membership and attendance to these events/knowing. 

## Step 2: Identify target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)

 *Demographic: middle aged women that live in a larger metropolitan city; mum or single or taken ladies; more likely to be those that recently moved/ are still unaccustomed to their location

 *Preferences: users have the desire to connect with new people and expand their network (for friendship, acquaintanceship, or activities focused) and need a trustworthy online application to assist them 

 *Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

#### Where would the users do this activity?

> There are two main activities that can be accomplished using the NextDoor app — connecting to neighbors in-app and learning/sharing essential information to living in the neighborhood. Users would discover and add potential friends online in-app (can find each other through mutual postings or joining online clubs/niche groups), while sharing/posting information can be accomplished remotely by users to whichever channel/category they see fit. The user interviewed in this contextual inquiry participated in the second task for various categories. If users were doing the simple "sharing information" activity but without using NextDoor, they would still be doing this activity in a a more scattered and disorganized manner (sharing amongst friends or posting adverts on sidewalks/shops/etc) or a public, potentially unsafe, Facebook group, etc.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?

> To get to know their neighborhood or find more information about thieir neighborhood, users would either rely on extended network in the city, use traditional social media such as Facebook Groups or Reddit for specific locations, or use traditional in person postings/adverts. To make friends in a new neighborhood, users would again rely on extended network (friends of friends, alumni network, etc), or traditional social media (Facebook,Tinder) or meet organically in person in the city (excluding COVID restrictions now). Or now, using NextDoor.

## Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

I conducted participatory observation research with a friend who fits my target activity details. Please find the materials used in the next section.

### Participatory Research Materials
#### 1. Contextual Inquiry Guide

> Please find my script for this interview [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17PUSJ-OuLa00a2k_DM0KpAxYRcPQlvSIZFmjjBNAem4/edit?usp=sharing), with goals and and contextual questions.

#### 2. User Data

> Please find the recording of the interview [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L-iYgi8VFfOCe1kIGaL90sWaQ1ems041/view?usp=sharing).

> The transcription of the interview can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1WMfx0VVxJOfw48NmH5iyCuUv0Td5EIxTUPTmTVyL0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Interview Key Insights
1️⃣ Hardest part of staying updated and connected with the community is a lack of a consolidated source (17:05)
> ...there's not a consolidated place for everything. Like for example sometimes I find stuff out faster than my family and have to tell them cause like unless you have a diversified outlet of information, then it's hard to stay updated. 

2️⃣ The user's suggestions for a "better" product than current solution (16:09)
> Actually yeah- like if you could like tag it and filter ; that would be cool; like if you're in a sad mood or if you’re like in a music mood.

3️⃣ What the user dislikes about their online community hub source currently (Facebook neighborhood group) (14:19)

> Uh i don't check this one that much but uhh yeah see it’s only like bad news which like is ; it’s supposed to be the news and music but like it’s overwhelmingly bad news which isn’t a bad thing; but uh ; if you notice there's this one admin who posts a lot so he's like the reporter and we just all like take it so if possible i’d like it so that like everyone participates...

4️⃣ User preference for community platforms (17:40)
> All depends like what I'm looking for- Uhhhh-  like - Facebook is more local or it’s like more specific they have more Facebook events- it's like more crime related - yeah- while the community subreddits in my hometown are like more political or like uh public event related and then uh the Instagram ones are more for like the overall culture. 

### Reflection

Overall, I found this Contextual Inquiry quite difficult. It's very hard to guesstimate what the user would actually want to do with your product or task (and I had a hard time with this as well for my Usability Test), so it was difficult to create a vague but assuming direction for my script. When I actually got to the interview part, it turned even weirder because I found that both my participant and I used a lot of unneccesary filler words that were damning enough to be distracting (uhh and like, for instance). This, of course, can be attributed to my restrictive script. 

However, even though this project was quite difficult, I enjoyed the process of interacting and understanding the user a little better without breathing over their neck over a formal script/tasking. And understanding these user personas, what really motivates them, was eye opening. It also made me realize that there are truly different flavors for users because I believe my user is more of a community lurker, versus poster.
