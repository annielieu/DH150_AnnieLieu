# DH150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry: Users in Context

#### by Annie Lieu // Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Fall 2020 // Dr. Sookyung Cho // 11.02.2020

## The Main Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

> <p> This project would support users in being able to get to know their neighborhood better, as well as find and connect with trusted people nearby, more easily. This will hopefully serve to make the community of middle aged womencommunity, whether mums or single ladies, in metropolitan cities happier and more excited to move to new places safely. </p>

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

> This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety and belongingness because they feel that they can trust people in their neighborhood/city better (saely because it's verified) as well as add to their network of potential friends and activities. They feel that they are not having a difficult moving or living in the city and that they are not alone; they they belong. 

#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

> Current technical solutions to satisfy this need for getting to know your neighborhood/city include other applications with adjacent websites, which are popular, but from personal observation, seem to confuse and muddle novel users because they do not effectively design for large user hubs (which is what an application built to learning and discovering your city requires). Older, more traditional solutions rely on local users finding solo papers in coffee shops/etc adveritsing a local club/org or from a personal friend network that could connect you to others they know in the city. 

#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

> Certain limitations for getting to know your neighborhood is the increasing danger of meeting strangers without prior vetting for safety. This could be improved by vetting every sign up user for a real valid mailing address, so a user can trust anyone registered in this neighborhood forum is an actual neighbor. That greatly decreases the chance of stranger danger. Other limitations lending to traditional views of getting to know your neighborhood include lack of user awareness. before, these orgs and local clubs relied on word of mouth, but because of an increase in contactless consumption, people are spending less and less time reading signs posted on coffee shops, etc and more and more of this form of marketing is being missed. Having a one stop online (semi-permanent] hub where all this information can be posted and easily found by those in the community would greatly increase membership and attendance to these events/knowing. 

## Step 2: Identify target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)

 *Demographic: middle aged women that live in a larger metropolitan city; mum or single or taken ladies; more likely to be those that recently moved/ are still unaccustomed to their location

 *Preferences: users have the desire to connect with new people and expand their network (for friendship, acquaintanceship, or activities focused) and need a trustworthy online application to assist them 

 *Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

#### Where would the users do this activity?

> There are two main activities that can be accomplished using the NextDoor app — connecting to neighbors in-app and learning/sharing essential information to living in the neighborhood. Users would discover and add potential friends online in-app (can find each other through mutual postings or joining online clubs/niche groups), while sharing/posting information can be accomplished remotely by users to whichever channel/category they see fit. The user interviewed in this contextual inquiry participated in the second task for various categories. If users were doing the simple "sharing information" activity but without using NextDoor, they would still be doing this activity in a a more scattered and disorganized manner (sharing amongst friends or posting adverts on sidewalks/shops/etc) or a public, potentially unsafe, Facebook group, etc.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?

> To get to know their neighborhood or find more information about thieir neighborhood, users would either rely on extended network in the city, use traditional social media such as Facebook Groups or Reddit for specific locations, or use traditional in person postings/adverts. To make friends in a new neighborhood, users would again rely on extended network (friends of friends, alumni network, etc), or traditional social media (Facebook,Tinder) or meet organically in person in the city (excluding COVID restrictions now). Or now, using NextDoor.

## Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

I conducted participatory observation research with a friend who fits my target activity details. Please find the materials used in the next section.
